Unlike other storage pods, your Cage Rocket purchase is not burdened by mounting clips, or velcro to fasten the pod to each of your bikes. We take advantage of the sturdy natural mounting system that exists on your bike already.</p>
      <p class="body_text">We  believe that a cyclist should never ride without identification, communication, money or credit card, and your keys. Where do you carry these essentials now? For as little as $10 USD you can have a secure place to always carry these critical items.</p>
      <p class="body_text">For bike commuters, have your essentials easily accessible and protected in a Cage Rocket. Hear your cell phone ring and stop to take that important call on your way to work. When you get to your destination it only takes seconds to remove the Cage Rocket and bring your valuables with you.</p>

      <p class="body_text_heading"><strong>You need both your Cages for Water Bottles?</strong></p>
      <p class="body_text">Most traditional bikes have 2 water bottle cages. For short rides, you don't need both water bottles, but you do need your ID, cell phone,  and keys. <span class="body_text_heading"><a href="sku02.htm" target="_blank"><img src="images/cage_rocket_seat_post_mounted.jpg" alt="Cage Rocket dual cages on seat post" width="342" height="300" border="0" align="left" /></a></span>For long rides many people now use hydro packs so that should free up a cage. </p>
      <p class="body_text">It is inconvenient to take your pack off to get to your cell phone or other essentials. If you ride with a hydro pack you will find the Cage Rocket is a wonderful addition for your bike providing instant accessibility to your essentials.</p>
      <p class="body_text">If you still need two cages for your water bottles, consider some of the ways to add more cages to your bicycle. Maybe a stacking cage,  handle bar, or seat post cage mounting bracket would be right for you. There are many products in the market today that allow for additional cages to be mounted on your bike.</p>

      <p class="body_text"><strong>Why is it that Shape?</strong></p>
      <p class="body_text">During the design of the  Cage Rocket   we narrowed our concepts to four final designs. Included in the final designs was a cylindrical shape that would fit into all cages. We used focus groups to give us feedback as to which design they liked best, and we went to production with the design they chose.</p>
      <p class="body_text">Many items that people want to carry in their personal storage pod are flat and rectangular including cell phones, cameras, PDA's, and MP3 players. With a cylindrical shape these items can only fit in the middle of the cylinder and then your storage is segmented with  two small crescent shapes  remaining to fit your other items. The Cage Rocket has a flat back which is perfect for these items. We then shaped our product to fill the open sides of an alloy cage, thereby giving you 20% more carrying space than a cylinder ever could. When you consider the efficiency of the space created by the flat back, and carrying PDA phones, cameras, or larger MP3 players, our shape creates up to 50% more space than a cylinder.<br />

      <p class="body_text">Therefore our shape does not fit the &quot;bat wing&quot; style cages and  the plastic cages with a circular entry. Alloy cages represent the largest installed base on bicycles worldwide. Our focus groups felt it was better to appeal to the largest segment of riders, and most importantly maximize the carrying space available in a standard cage.</p>
      <p class="body_text">One last benefit of our shape is that when you are mountain biking and stop to take a break to eat your energy bar on that rock overlook with beautiful expansive view, and you lay your pod down with cell phone inside, it won't roll off the rock and drop into oblivion like a roudn container will. </p><br>

      <p class="body_text_heading"><strong>Water Bottle Cages We Fit</strong></p>
      <p class="body_text">We fit metal alloy water bottle cages with open sides. You can see in the overlay section above that our shape is not round. We therefore need a cage with open sides to fit our product. Examples of cages we fit are below.
